Turing-Simulator
================

A Turing machine simulator that identifies anagrams and palindromes. 
<p>
The purpose of this project is to simulate a Turing Machine that accepts a string from alphabet
{a, c, e, r} and determine whether it is an anagram of string “raccare”, a palindrome or both.
</p>
* Anagram is a string formed by rearranging the letters of another string
* Palindrome is a string that is spelled the same forwards and backwards


The machine halts, whether it:
* accepts or rejects string as anagram
* accepts or rejects string as palindrome
* accepts or rejects string as being both an anagram and palindrome
